# Why malware in Rust?
I guess to level your adversarial game

### 🔰 **Phase 1: Foundations (Beginner)**
Goal: Understand basic malware concepts, goals, and tools.

#### 📘 Concepts to Learn:
- **What is malware?**
 a malicious program
 Types: trojans, ransomware, rootkits, worms,  etc.
- **Malware goals:** Persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration
- **Windows Internals:** Registry, processes, services, APIs
- **Linux basics** (especially if targeting mixed environments)
- **The CIA Triad**: How malware impacts Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

#### 🛠️ Tools to Get Familiar With:
- Virtual lab setup with **VMware/VirtualBox** + **Remnux**, **FlareVM**, **Kali**, and a **Windows target**
- **Wireshark** & **Procmon** to watch malware behavior
- **Sysinternals Suite**
- **PEStudio**, **CFF Explorer**, **VirusTotal**

#### 📚 Resources:
- Book: *The Art of Memory Forensics* – Lays foundational knowledge.
- Book: *Practical Malware Analysis* – Great for understanding static/dynamic analysis.
- Labs: [Malware Traffic Analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/), [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)

### 🧰 **Phase 2: Basic Malware Development (Intermediate)**
Goal: Write basic malware functionality and understand detection and evasion techniques.

#### 💻 Skills to Develop:
- Write basic malware in **Rust**
  - Keylogger
  - Reverse shell
  - Persistence (registry, startup folder, services)
- Static vs dynamic evasion (packers, obfuscation)
- Learn **Windows API** usage
- Use **Reflective DLL Injection**, **process hollowing**

#### 🧪 Practice:
- Build your own:
  - Dropper (downloads and executes payload)
  - Binder (binds malware to legit file)
  - C2 client/server using HTTP or DNS

#### 🔧 Tools/Frameworks:
- **Metasploit** (study how payloads work)
- **Cobalt Strike (trial)** or **Sliver** for emulation
- **Donut** (to create shellcode from PE files)
- **Shellter**, **Veil**, **Pupy**, **Empire**

#### 📚 Resources:
- Book: *Red Team Development and Operations* – Practical field skills
- GitHub: Explore malware repos (safely, in lab only)
- YouTube: John Hammond, OALabs, IppSec

### 👾 **Phase 3: Advanced Malware Development**
Goal: Learn stealth, advanced delivery, and bypassing modern defenses.

#### 🧠 Topics to Master:
- **AV/EDR evasion techniques**
  - API unhooking
  - Inline syscalls
  - Living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins)
  - User-mode vs kernel-mode detection
- **Memory-only malware** (fileless)
- **Malware encryption** (AES, RSA) and C2 channel encryption
- **Stagers and multi-stage loaders**
- **Windows Defender & EDR bypasses** (e.g., AMSI, ETW)
- **Kernel drivers (Rootkits)** – Dangerous territory, very advanced

#### 🔥 Advanced Tools/Projects:
- **Nim** or **Rust** for stealth malware
- **SysWhispers / SysWhispers2** – Direct syscall invocation
- **BOF (Beacon Object Files)** – Used in Cobalt Strike and Sliver
- **Infection Monkey** and **Caldera** – Automation of techniques
- **Red Team Operator course by Zero-Point Security**

#### 🧠 Red Team Mindset:
- Think like an attacker, write like a developer, behave like a ghost.
- Know how defenses *detect* things so you can bypass them.
- Document everything – repeatability is key.

### ✅ Ongoing Practice
- Participate in labs like:
  - [TryHackMe Red Team Path](https://tryhackme.com)
  - [HackTheBox - Pro Labs](https://www.hackthebox.com)
- Build out a **portfolio of TTPs** modeled on [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- Follow threats & malware dev research on:
  - Twitter/Bluesky
  - [Red Canary Blog](https://redcanary.com/blog/)
  - [malapi.io](https://malapi.io/) – Interactive Windows API index

### Wanna Start Right Now?
I can guide you through writing a basic malware (like a reverse shell) in C or Go, then progressively make it more stealthy and modular. Want to do that together?

Let’s turn you from “gray” to “ghost” 🕵️‍♂️💻
